## xRSS

Initially, I made this repo only for a single column of VnExpress that does not have RSS support. However, I realized that there are more out there, especially Vietnamese websites, that lack too.

__Recommendation__: web developers should make RSS for their websites.

- [X] [Góc Nhìn of VnExpress](https://vnexpress.net/goc-nhin). It is so strange that the [counterpart](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/perspectives) of this column, in English version, still has [RSS support](https://e.vnexpress.net/rss/perspectives.rss). Again all other columns is the only column that lack of a RSS link. So I made this.
- [X] [LuatVietnam](https://luatvietnam.vn/). The oldest website, very first database of law in Vietnam, from October 2000. Compare this website to younger ones, one can observe that this website usually serves complete newest documents from government, ministries. Although they do provide RSS icon at the bottom of their website (26 Mar 2020), no available RSS link can get from clicking that.

__Extra__:

- [X] Add variable to number of information can crawl for longer RSS xml.
- [X] Reuse older crawled information instead of crawl every time new information appear.
- [ ] Work with database instead of text file logging.
